Installation:
Running on-demand:
Using npx you can run the script without installing it first:
`npx http-server [path] [options]`
Globally via npm
`npm install --global http-server`
This will install http-server globally so that it may be run from the command line anywhere.

Usage:
`http-server [path] [options]`
[path] defaults to ./public if the folder exists, and ./ otherwise.
Now you can visit http://localhost:8080 to view your server
